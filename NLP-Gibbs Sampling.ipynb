    "# Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Gibbs sampling is a technique for **generating samples from multi-dimensional distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason it's a challenging task is because the **joint distribution is unknown**: we cannot sample directly from it. We only know some of the conditional distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a two-dimensional variable (x, y) we don't know the joint probability p(x, y). But we know conditional distributions such as, p(y | x) and p(x | y). Gibbs sampling provides a technique to use these two conditional distributions to sample from the unknown joint distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use a simple example to understand how Gibbs sampling works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rolling Two Dice\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have two fair dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ represent the outcome of the first die and $y$ be the sum of the outcome of two dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to generate lots of (x, y) pairs by using Gibbs sampling technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do this, let's simplify the problem. Assume we know the joint probability distribution of (x, y), hence can **directly sample from the joint distribution**."
